Simon Game
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

The above mentioned game is entirely replicated in the form of a web-application using simple html,css and javascript only.
